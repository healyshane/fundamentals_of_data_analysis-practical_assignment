# Practical Assignment, Fundamentals of Data Analysis
Shane Healy, OCT-2018

This repository contains:
* A Jupyter Notebook
* Apache License Version 2.0
* Anscombe data set in CSV format

The objective of this assignment was to analyse Anscombe's Quartet Dataset. 
This was performed in a Jupyter Notebook, available through Anaconda distribution and code was written using Python. 

Git was used to track changes to repository and Jupyter Notebook.

To view and run the Jupyter Notebook, right click on .pynb file, Save link as... to your machine and run Jupyter Notebook through Command Line. The data file, asc_data.csv, is saved to repository and will also need to be saved to local machine as Jupyter Notebook references it.
